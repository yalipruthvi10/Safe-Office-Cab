# Safe Office Cab – Smart Employee & Women Safety Transport System

# Project Overview

Safe Office Cab is an intelligent transportation safety system designed to enhance employee safety—especially women—during office travel hours. With increasing work shifts during early mornings and late nights, ensuring secure commuting has become a critical need. This system integrates real-time monitoring, emergency alerting, and driver accountability using modern IoT technologies.

The solution uses a Raspberry Pi 3B as the central controller and integrates GPS tracking, alcohol detection, smoke detection, a camera module, and a panic button to ensure continuous monitoring and immediate emergency response.

 # Objectives

* To design and implement a smart safety system for office cabs.
* To provide real-time GPS tracking and route monitoring.
* To detect unsafe conditions such as alcohol consumption and smoke inside the cab.
* To enable instant emergency alerts using a panic button.
* To integrate Blynk App & Cloud for real-time monitoring and notifications.


# Motivation

Employee transportation safety has become a major concern, particularly for women travelling during early morning and late evening hours. Many existing cab services lack real-time tracking, route monitoring, and emergency support, leading to unsafe travel conditions and delayed responses during critical situations. The Safe Office Cab system is motivated by the need for a secure, reliable, and technology-driven transport solution that ensures safer commuting for working professionals.
